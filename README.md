Write a program to learn a na√Øve Bayes classifier and use it to predict class labels of test data. <em>Laplacian smoothing should be used</em>. The learned classifier should be tested on test instances and the accuracy of prediction for the test instances should be printed as output. A single program should train the classifier on the training set as well as test it on the test set.

<em>Data Set Description:  </em>

The task is to predict whether a citizen is happy to live in a city based on certain parameters of the city as rated by the citizens in a scale of 1-5 during a survey.




Attribute Information:

D = decision/class attribute (D) with values 0 (unhappy) and 1 (happy) (Column 1 of file) X1 = the availability of information about the city services (Column 2 of file) X2 = the cost of housing

X3 = the overall quality of public schools

X4 = your trust in the local police

X5 = the maintenance of streets and sidewalks

X6 = the availability of social community events




Attributes X1 to X6 have values 1 to 5.




Training Data Filename: <em>data2_19.csv, </em>Test Data Filename: <em>test2_19.csv </em>

<em>Submission Guidelines: </em>

You may use one of the following languages: c/C++/Java/Python. You should name your file as &lt;rollnumber_2.extension&gt; (e.g., 15CS10001_2.c). Your program should be <u>standalone</u> and should not use any <em>special purpose</em> library. Numpy/pandas may be used. You should submit the program file only and not the output/input file. The submitted <u>single</u> program file <em>should</em> have the following header comments:

# Roll               # Name           # Assignment number           # Specific compilation/execution flags (if required)
